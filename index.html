  <h1>Privacy Policy for TalkWrite</h1>
  <p>TalkWrite is a voice and text utility app that allows users to record audio, convert speech to text and vice versa, and manage audio/text content locally on their devices.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>TalkWrite does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal information</strong> from users. All recordings, text, and files are processed and stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and are not transmitted to any server.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong>: To record voice input.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: To save and access recordings and text files locally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are used solely for core app functionality and not for data collection.</p>

  <h2>No Account or Login Required</h2>
  <p>Users are not required to create an account or log in. TalkWrite functions fully offline and does not connect to any external server or database.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. Sharing features are user-initiated (e.g., using device-native sharing functions) and are not tracked or recorded by the app.</p>
